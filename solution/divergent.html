    <p>At first, questions may seem hard to answer, but there are actually two unique answers for each, also suggested by the fact that each question is repeated twice. The answers are sorted alphabetically to aid in identification.
<br><br>In the book <i>Divergent</i>, members of the society who are labelled as "divergent" are part of multiple factions. 
Noticing the ABCDE, we can correspond each answer to faction(s), thus creating a binary numbers by whether an answer is part of a particular faction (hinted by "one or zero" and "in a faction or not"). This is determined by whether the answers have the letters A, B, C, D, and/or E (hinted by the strange capitilzation of the flavortext, where ABCDE are capitalized).
For example, to the question "Nationality of the parents of YouTuber J Lou?" the answer is both FRENCH and CHINESE. One answer, CHINESE, has an E and a C, creating the binary number 00101 or 5 = E.
Repeat this process for each question, and to disambiguate on which answer corresponds with what clue, the questions are given in alphabetical order by answer.
Sorting by question number gives <b>REGENERATION</b>.</p>

    <h4>Author&rsquo;s Notes</h4>
    <p>I really tried my hardest to write ambigious clues that uniquely clued two answers. I'm proud of incorporating "Full first name of the US president during 2021", as during testsolving 
I loved getting the reaction "Oh Joseph. Wait... wasn't Trump a president as well? Is this question ambigious?". Clues like SECOND/CENTURY and BOWDITCH/ODAY were not my favorite and hard to 
find a better alternative.</p>
